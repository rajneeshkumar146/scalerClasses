     * 8. Bookmarks.
     * 
     * Question: How browser allows to access these features developer -> developing a UI app ??
     * Answer:
     * 
     * 1. WEB API: is the interface to access all the components or the features.
     * 2. API(Application programming interface): API is an object that represent a feature and developer can intract with API using it's exposed prop and methods.
     * 3. You can use JS to intract with all these API
     * 4. WEB API: console, DOM API, web storgae API, Fetch API etc.,
     * 
     * 
     * First Principle is: To implement any feature -> You have to use an API given by Browser and that API 
     * is always an object -> method and props and we will use JS to do it.
